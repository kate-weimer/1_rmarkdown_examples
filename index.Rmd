# Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultural diversions**


## Site Description

The Cache la Poudre, or "Poudre" River is located in the Front Range of Colorado's Rocky Mountains. The name comes from French trappers who hid their gunpowder near the river. The Arapahoe name for the river is _ho'oowu' heetou'_ , which means 'where a house is located,' according to [CU Boulder's Center for the Study of Indigenous Languages of the West](https://www.colorado.edu/center/csilw/language-archives/arapaho-word-lists/place-names). The Poudre River is a tributarty of the South Platte, which later joins the Platte River, which is a tributary of the Missouri River, which in turn feeds the [Mississippi River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River) and **flows into the Gulf of Mexico**. According to the [Coalition for the Poudre River Watershed](https://www.poudrewatershed.org/cache-la-poudre-watershed), the Poudre supports water supply for **over 330,000 residents and 151,547 acres of irrigated land**.

## Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

## Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```



## Static Data Plotter


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


## Interactive Data Plotter


```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") %>% dyEvent("2017-5-27", "27 May", labelLoc = "top") %>% dyEvent("2018-5-28", "28 May", labelLoc = "top")%>% dyEvent("2019-6-09", "09 Jun", labelLoc = "top")%>% dyEvent("2020-6-01", "01 Jun", labelLoc = "top")%>% dyEvent("2021-5-23", "23 May", labelLoc = "top")
```



# Assignment. 


This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertice in using
RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and 
assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to:


1) Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub

2) Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. 

3) Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of
headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document)

4) Make a version of the `dygraph` with points and lines by using rstudio's
dygraph [guide](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/)

5) Writing a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks,
**two bolded sections**, and one *italicized phrase*. The content of this paragraph
is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course,
don't plagiarize. 

6) Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub.

7) Use the GitHub -> Settings -> Pages tab to create a website of your report.

8) Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds
todays date, not just a static date you enter. 

9) Bonus, create an "index_talk.Rmd" version of your document using the
`revealjs` package. Add link to your original report-style document.
